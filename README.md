Animal Adoption Application 
Specification Draft 

General description: This application aims to help both potential owners and the animal 
shelter by offering the possibility to make animal adoption more accessible and efficient. 

Registration (for both the Client and the Animal Shelter):  
The user needs to first register into the application by selecting one of the two roles: client or shelter 
manager. Both roles require a unique username and a password. 

Animal Shelter: 
After the shelter manager logs in, he can add, edit or delete the profiles of the animals available for 
adoption. 
Also, after logging in, he will see a list of all the adoption applications. 
From the list of applications, the manager can reject or approve a request. 

Client: 
A client needs to log into the application where he will be able to see a list of all the animals available for 
adoption.  
A logged-in customer can also filter the animals available, by selecting the species. 
A logged-in customer can place an application for the desired animal.
